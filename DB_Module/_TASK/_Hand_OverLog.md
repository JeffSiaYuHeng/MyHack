# Agent Handover Log

> This file is the **inter-agent communication channel**. Each agent appends a handover entry when transferring control to the next agent.  
> The receiving agent reads the latest entry to understand context, status, and any flags before starting work.  
> Entries are **append-only** during a task cycle. The Archivist clears this file at milestone boundaries.

- Refactored `Dockerfile` into dependency, development, builder, and production runner targets.
- Updated `docker-compose.yml` for hot-reload local development with optional `APP_PORT` override.
- Installed local npm dependencies.

### Flags / Blockers
- Port `3000` is occupied by unrelated container `aco-emsp-local-frontend-1`, so verification used `APP_PORT=3001`.
- Env values are placeholders and must be replaced for real Gemini/Firebase calls.

### Handover Payload
- `Dockerfile`

## 2026-05-16 14:10 — Coder → Evaluator

**Status**: DONE

### What Was Done
- Updated `app/layout.tsx`: title → `"Verrier"`, description → `"AI-powered relationship management for innovation programmes"`.
- Rewrote `app/page.tsx` — removed all MyHack scaffold content:
  - Team-member cards removed.
  - Scaffold status and topic-drop waiting state removed.
  - Decorative gradient headline removed.
- New root route renders Verrier operational overview:
  - Header: product name + program name (left), cohort name + programme length + status (right).
  - Compact 8-cell metric strip: active programmes, cohorts, submitted applications, approved, relationships, healthy, at-risk, critical — all derived from `getDashboardSummary()`.
  - Attention Feed (2/3 width): all active relationships from `getAttentionFeed()`, each card shows company, mentor, health score, days since last meeting, first watch point, and AI diagnosis.
  - Recent Meetings (1/3 width): 5 most recent meetings from `getRecentMeetings(5)`, each card shows company, mentor, date, signal dot, and AI summary.
  - Health band badges use Morandi semantic colors (green/amber/red). No gradients, no orbs.
- `Button` import removed (no clear root-route actions needed).
- All displayed data is deterministic, sourced from seed + analytics helpers.

### Flags / Blockers
- No blockers.

### Verification
- `npm run lint` PASSED (zero errors, zero warnings).

## 2026-05-16 14:30 — Evaluator → Planner

**Status**: PASSED

### What Was Done
- Build verification: SUCCESS.
- Scope audit: CLEAN.
- Ticked "Update global metadata and root route copy..." in `_PLAN.md`.
- Verified metadata and root page implementation against `02_STYLE_GUIDE.md`.

### Strategic Anchor
- Phase: PHASE_1__Verrier_Product_Foundation
- Block: Block B — App Shell and Design Tokens

### Acceptance Audit
- Result: PASSED (Root app no longer presents as MyHack; Verrier styling initiated).

### Flags / Blockers
- Root page uses a hardcoded dense layout for now; Task 3 will introduce the reusable shell.
- Ready for Task 2: `app/globals.css` design token alignment.

### Handover Payload

### Flags / Blockers
- Latest Evaluator handoff reports metadata/root-copy task passed and `_PLAN.md` already ticked it.
- `app/globals.css` is imported by `app/layout.tsx`; route and component files remain read-only for this instruction.
- `components/ui/button.tsx` consumes shared tokens and remains read-only.

- Sidebar tokens: surface-low (#f4f3f0) + primary family (#4a5e6f)
- Semantic status tokens added: `--status-healthy`, `--status-healthy-bg`, `--status-risk`, `--status-risk-bg`, `--status-critical`, `--status-critical-bg`, `--status-ai`, `--status-pending`

#### Token groups updated — `.dark`
- Low-contrast dark Morandi variant: warm dark backgrounds (#1a1b18), readable light foreground (#e3e2df)

## 2026-05-16 13:16 — Planner → Coder

**Status**: DONE

### What Was Done
- Updated `_TASK/_PLAN.md` current target to the reusable coordinator product shell task.
- Created `_TASK/_INSTRUCTION.md` targeting task: "Create a reusable coordinator product shell for authenticated product pages."
- Checked `_PHASES/00_ROADMAP.md`, `PHASE_1__Verrier_Product_Foundation.md`, `_Hand_OverLog.md`, `_DOCS/00_STRUCTURE.md`, `_DOCS/02_STYLE_GUIDE.md`, `_DOCS/06_DEPENDENCY_GRAPH.md`, and current `app/page.tsx` before defining scope.

### Flags / Blockers
- Latest Evaluator handoff reports design-token alignment passed and `_PLAN.md` already ticked it.
- `components/features/` exists and is the selected location for `components/features/product-shell.tsx`.
- The root route currently contains hardcoded shell-like layout that should be moved into the reusable shell without adding new routes.
- `components/ui/button.tsx` and `app/globals.css` remain read-only for this instruction.

**Status**: DONE

### What Was Done
- Read Next.js local docs: `03-layouts-and-pages.md` and `05-server-and-client-components.md` before implementation.
- Created `components/features/product-shell.tsx` (new file).
- Updated `app/page.tsx` to use `ProductShell`.

#### `components/features/product-shell.tsx`
- Exports named `ProductShell` function component — no `"use client"`, server-component compatible.
- Props: `children: React.ReactNode`, `programName: string`, `cohortName: string`, `cohortWeeks: number`, `cohortStatus: string`, `activeNav?: string`.
- Structure: outer `min-h-screen bg-background text-foreground` wrapper → `<header>` (Verrier wordmark + programName left, cohortName + weeks + status right) → `<nav>` (Dashboard / Programmes / Matching / Relationships links via `next/link`, active item highlighted with `border-primary`) → `<div class="max-w-[1440px] mx-auto">{children}</div>`.
- Uses Tailwind token classes: `bg-background`, `text-foreground`, `text-muted-foreground`, `border-border`, `bg-card`, `border-primary`.
- Responsive margins: `px-4` mobile (16px), `md:px-12` desktop (48px).

#### `app/page.tsx`
- Removed hardcoded outer wrapper, header, and static shell structure.
- Imports `ProductShell` from `@/components/features/product-shell`.
- Passes `program.name`, `cohort.name`, `cohort.totalWeeks`, `cohort.status`, `activeNav="Dashboard"` as props.
- All page-specific content preserved: dashboard summary metric strip, attention feed, recent meetings.
- Switched hardcoded hex classes on cards to `border-border` and `bg-card` token classes.
- `MetricCell` now uses `text-foreground` instead of hardcoded `#1b1c1a`.

### Flags / Blockers
- Navigation links for `/programmes`, `/matching`, `/relationships` point to routes that do not exist yet (they return 404). These are placeholder hrefs for future Block C/D implementation.

### Verification
- `npm run lint` PASSED (zero errors, zero warnings).

## 2026-05-16 15:35 — Evaluator → Archivist

**Status**: PASSED

- Created `_TASK/_INSTRUCTION.md` targeting task: "Create the `/dashboard` route and move the existing seeded command-center content into a reusable dashboard feature component shared by `/` and `/dashboard`."

### Flags / Blockers
- Block B completion is based on the Evaluator handoff at `2026-05-16 15:35`, which reports all Block B acceptance checks passed.
- `DB_Module/_DOCS/06_DEPENDENCY_GRAPH.md` is stale for the new shell imports and should be treated as baseline dependency context only.
- `components/ui/button.tsx` remains read-only because it is high-impact in the dependency graph.

### Handover Payload
- `DB_Module/_PHASES/PHASE_1__Verrier_Product_Foundation.md`
- `DB_Module/_PHASES/00_ROADMAP.md`
- `_TASK/_PLAN.md`

- Created `app/dashboard/page.tsx` (new route file).
- Simplified `app/page.tsx` — replaced inline dashboard content with `DashboardCommandCenter`.
- Updated `components/features/product-shell.tsx` — Dashboard nav link changed from `"/"` to `"/dashboard"`.

#### `components/features/dashboard-command-center.tsx`
- Named export `DashboardCommandCenter` — no `"use client"`, server-component compatible.
- Reads analytics directly: `getDashboardSummary()`, `getAttentionFeed()`, `getRecentMeetings(5)`.
- Contains all extracted dashboard-specific helpers: `bandBadgeClass`, `signalDotClass`, `MetricCell`.
- Renders metric strip (8 cells) + Attention Feed (lg:col-span-2) + Recent Meetings (1/3).
- Uses `border-border`, `bg-card`, `text-foreground`, `text-muted-foreground` Morandi token classes.

#### `app/dashboard/page.tsx`
- New route at `/dashboard`.
- Renders `ProductShell` (programme/cohort props from seed, `activeNav="Dashboard"`) wrapping `DashboardCommandCenter`.

#### `app/page.tsx`
- Root `/` now renders `ProductShell` + `DashboardCommandCenter` — matches `/dashboard`.
- All inline metric, feed, and meeting markup removed.

#### `components/features/product-shell.tsx`
- Dashboard nav href: `"/"` → `"/dashboard"`. Active-nav matching unchanged.

### Flags / Blockers
- No blockers.
- Both `/` and `/dashboard` render the same content. Redirect from `/` is out of scope.

### Verification
- `npm run lint` PASSED (zero errors, zero warnings).

- Created `_TASK/_INSTRUCTION.md` targeting task: "Add a minimal demo login route and document the public versus coordinator route boundary."

### Flags / Blockers
- Block D must not implement real Firebase Auth, Firestore writes, or security rules in the first task.
- `lib/firebase.ts` already initializes Firebase Auth and Firestore, but remains read-only for this instruction.
- `DB_Module/_DOCS/03_SERVER_ACTIONS.md` is in scope because route-boundary documentation must stay accurate.

### Handover Payload

## 2026-05-16 14:15 — Coder → Evaluator

**Status**: PASSED

### What Was Done

- Created `app/login/page.tsx` — server component (no `"use client"`), demo auth placeholder with Verrier identity, demo-mode notice, and a `Continue to Dashboard` link to `/dashboard`. Morandi token classes used throughout. Compact panel layout, no hero or decorative gradients.
- Updated `components/features/product-shell.tsx`:
  - Added `Demo coordinator` badge in the shell header, inline with the Verrier wordmark.
  - Added `Login` nav item linking to `/login` at the end of `NAV_ITEMS`.
- Updated `DB_Module/_DOCS/03_SERVER_ACTIONS.md`:
  - Prepended a "Route Boundary Reference" section with a public-routes table (`/`, `/login`, planned `/apply/[programId]`, planned `/submit-meeting`) and a coordinator-routes table (`/dashboard`, planned `/programmes`, `/matching`, `/relationships`).
  - Added explicit note that `/login` is a demo placeholder with no real Firebase Auth or session.

### Route Boundary Summary

| Boundary | Routes |
|---|---|
| Public | `/`, `/login`, `/apply/[programId]` (future), `/submit-meeting` (future) |
| Coordinator | `/dashboard`, `/programmes` (future), `/matching` (future), `/relationships` (future) |

`/login` is demo-only; no credentials validated, no session created.

## 2026-05-16 14:45 — Coder → Evaluator

**Status**: DONE

### What Was Done

- Created `components/features/program-setup-wizard.tsx` — client component (`"use client"`).
  - Five sections: Basics, Target Profile, Criteria Weights, Application Setup, Mentor Setup.
  - Local `WizardState` captures: `name`, `type`, `description`, `targetStages`, `targetIndustries`, `targetMarkets`, `selectionCriteria` (5 weights), `requiredDocuments`, `applicationOpenAt`, `applicationCloseAt`, `startDate`, `endDate`, `mentorIds`.
  - Criteria weights (stageWeight, industryWeight, tractionWeight, teamWeight, needsFitWeight) are number inputs with bar visualisers; total displayed with health colour.
  - Required documents (pitchDeck, companyRegistration, tractionSummary, founderProfiles) are checkboxes.
  - All 15 seed mentors rendered as selectable rows with name, role, company, expertise, and h/mo.
  - `previewProgram` const satisfies the `Program` shape — id fixed to `"program-draft-local"`, status fixed to `"draft"`.
  - Preview panel (sticky, right column) shows: programme name, type, status, mentor count, criteria total, application URL `/apply/program-draft-local`, and completion flags when not ready.
- Created `app/programs/new/page.tsx` — server component; renders `ProductShell` with `activeNav="Programmes"` + `ProgramSetupWizard`.
- Updated `components/features/product-shell.tsx` — changed `Programmes` nav href from `/programmes` to `/programs/new`.

## 2026-05-16 15:20 — Coder → Evaluator

**Status**: DONE

### What Was Done

- Created `components/features/public-application-form.tsx` — client component (`"use client"`).
  - Six sections: Programme Summary (display), Company Profile, Founder Profile, Support Needs, Document Metadata, Fit Preview.
  - Local state: `CompanyFormState` (typed via `Company["stage"]`, `Company["businessModel"]`), `FounderFormState` (typed via `Pick<Founder, ...>`), `AppFormFields` (founderContactEmail, founderSummary, supportNeeds, documentUrls).
  - `Application` used for `submittedApp` state type and the draft Application object.
  - All three imported types (`Application`, `Company`, `Founder`) are structurally used.
  - Support needs toggle syncs both `appFields.supportNeeds` (Application) and `company.needsHelp` (Company) in one action.
  - Inline validation errors shown before submit button; button is disabled when validation fails.
  - On valid submit: builds deterministic `Application` object (`id: "application-draft-local"`, `status: "submitted"`, `fitScore: 0`, `fitLabel: "Potential fit"`, `aiRecommendation: "review"`), stores in state, shows confirmation view.
  - Confirmation view shows: status, company name, founderContactEmail, fitLabel.
  - Fit Preview section shows "Pending AI score" / "Ready for scoring" placeholder with explanatory note.
  - No `ProductShell`, no auth, mobile-friendly single-column `max-w-2xl` layout.
- Created `app/apply/[programId]/page.tsx` — async server component; `await params` to read `programId`; falls back to `seedPrograms[0]` if ID not found; passes programme props to `PublicApplicationForm`.

### Form Sections Implemented

| Section | Fields |
|---|---|
| Programme Summary | Display only (programName, programType, programDescription, targetStages) |
| Company Profile | name, registrationNumber, stage, businessModel, industry, country, city, teamSize, revenueMonthly, needsHelp |
| Founder Profile | name, role, email, background, linkedInUrl, founderContactEmail |
| Support Needs | supportNeeds (checkboxes), founderSummary |
| Document Metadata | pitchDeck, companyRegistration, tractionSummary, founderProfiles |
| Fit Preview | Placeholder display — Pending AI score / Ready for scoring |

### Validation Summary

Required fields blocking submission: company name, founder name, founderContactEmail, founderSummary, at least one supportNeed, pitchDeck URL, companyRegistration URL. All others optional.

### Confirmation State Summary

Shown after valid local submit: status ("submitted"), company name, founderContactEmail, fitLabel ("Potential fit (pending)"), plus a note that AI scoring is pending.

### Lint Result

`npm run lint` — PASSED, no errors or warnings.

### Flags / Blockers

- No Firestore, Gemini, or API routes added.
- Route is public — no ProductShell, no auth.
- No files modified outside Context Scope.
- Ready for Evaluator audit.

## 2026-05-16 16:00 — Coder → Evaluator

**Status**: DONE

### What Was Done

- Created `app/api/ai/program-fit/route.ts` — POST route handler.
  - Validates: `programId` (string), `companyProfile` (object), `founderSummary` (non-empty string), `supportNeeds` (non-empty array), `submittedDocumentTypes` (array). Returns `400` for missing or invalid fields.
  - Calls Gemini server-side with `responseMimeType: "application/json"` and a structured fit-scoring prompt. Malaysia context guardrail included (judges business/professional fit only).
  - Parses and validates AI response: `fitScore`, `fitLabel`, `aiRecommendation`, `aiInsight`, `breakdown.*`, `eligibilityFlags`.
  - Clamps all score fields to 0–100 via `clamp()`. Normalises invalid `fitLabel` to `"Potential fit"` and invalid `aiRecommendation` to `"review"`.
  - Returns `status: "scored"` on success.
  - Returns recoverable `PENDING_RESPONSE` (`status: "pending"`, zeroed scores, `eligibilityFlags: ["scoring-pending"]`) on Gemini failure, network error, or malformed JSON.
- Updated `components/features/public-application-form.tsx`.
  - Added `FitResult` interface and `FitState` type (`idle | loading | scored | pending | error`).
  - Added `fitState` and `fitResult` useState.
  - Changed `handleSubmit` to `async`. Phase 1 (state `idle` or `error`): calls `POST /api/ai/program-fit` with company profile, founderSummary, supportNeeds, and submitted document keys. Phase 2 (state `scored` or `pending`): builds Application object using scored values and sets `submittedApp`.
  - Updated Fit Preview section to display loading, scored, pending, and error states.
  - Submit button label cycles: "Get fit score & submit" → "Scoring..." → "Confirm & submit".
  - Confirmation panel now shows `fitScore` and `fitLabel` from the scored Application.
- Updated `DB_Module/_DOCS/03_SERVER_ACTIONS.md` — added `status: "scored" | "pending"` field to the `POST /api/ai/program-fit` response block with a note on pending-state behavior.

### Route Request / Response Summary

Request: `{ programId, companyProfile, founderSummary, supportNeeds, submittedDocumentTypes }`
Success response: `{ fitScore, fitLabel, aiRecommendation, aiInsight, breakdown, eligibilityFlags, status: "scored" }`
Pending response: `{ fitScore: 0, fitLabel: "Potential fit", aiRecommendation: "review", aiInsight: <pending note>, breakdown: <zeroed>, eligibilityFlags: ["scoring-pending"], status: "pending" }`

### Public Form Wiring Summary

- First click → validates form → calls `/api/ai/program-fit` → shows scored or pending result in Fit Preview.
- Second click → builds Application with scored values → shows confirmation panel.
- If Gemini is unavailable: form shows pending result and allows confirmation with zeroed scores.

### Pending-State Behavior

If Gemini is unavailable or returns malformed JSON:
- Route returns PENDING_RESPONSE with `status: "pending"`.
- Form shows pending notice in Fit Preview.
- User can still confirm submission; Application is built with `fitScore: 0`, `fitLabel: "Potential fit"`, `aiRecommendation: "review"`.

### Lint Result

`npm run lint` — PASSED, no errors or warnings.

### Flags / Blockers

- No Firestore or application persistence added.
- Gemini calls are server-side only (route handler).
- No files modified outside Context Scope.
- Ready for Evaluator audit.

## 2026-05-16 18:55 — Coder → Evaluator

**Status**: DONE

### What Was Done

- Created `components/features/applicant-review-pool.tsx` — client component (`"use client"`).
  - Imports `Application`, `ApplicationStatus`, `Company` via `import type` from `lib/types`.
  - Imports `seedApplications`, `seedCompanies` from `lib/verrier-seed`.
  - Local state: `applications` (seeded pool, all 12 entries), `activeFilter`, `selectedId`, `isLoading`, `error`.
  - Company join: `companyMap: Map<string, Company>` keyed by `companyId` — each application resolved to its company inline.
  - Filters (6): all, submitted, shortlisted, approved, waitlisted, declined — counts show live application counts.
  - Dense applicant list (left panel, `w-72`): company name, founderContactEmail, status badge (Morandi semantic tokens), fitScore, fitLabel, AI recommendation.
  - Detail panel (right, `flex-1`): company profile (businessModel, teamSize, MRR, contact), fit breakdown (5-bar score visualiser), founder summary, AI insight + recommendation, support needs chips, eligibility flags (with warning dots), document metadata (docType + filename).
  - Decision action buttons: Approve, Shortlist, Waitlist, Decline — all use Morandi semantic status tokens for color. Active status disables its own button.
  - `applyLocalDecision(applications, applicationId, status): Application[]` — pure function; updates local state array. Comment marks it as the future Firestore action boundary.
  - `handleDecision` calls `setApplications(prev => applyLocalDecision(...))`.
  - Approved companies summary band: deduped by `companyId`, shown above filters with Morandi healthy-green chips.
  - Empty state: "No applicants match this filter." shown when filtered list is empty.
  - Loading state: "Loading applicant pool..." shown when `isLoading` is true.
  - Error state: message styled with `--status-critical` token shown when `error` is non-null.

- Created `app/programs/[programId]/applicants/page.tsx` — async server component.
  - `await params` for `programId` (Next.js App Router pattern).
  - Falls back to `seedPrograms[0]` if `programId` not found.
  - Renders `ProductShell` with `activeNav="Programmes"` wrapping `ApplicantReviewPool`.

- Updated `components/features/product-shell.tsx`.
  - Changed `Programmes` nav href from `/programs/new` to `/programs/program-cradle-accelerator-2026/applicants` to keep coordinator navigation coherent with the new primary review route.

### Filter / List / Detail Implementation Summary

| Area | Implementation |
|---|---|
| Filters | 6 tabs (all / submitted / shortlisted / approved / waitlisted / declined), live counts from local state |
| List | company name, email, status badge, fitScore, fitLabel, AI recommendation — per applicant row |
| Detail | company profile, fit bar chart, founder summary, AI insight, support needs, eligibility flags, document metadata |

### Local Decision Action Summary

- `applyLocalDecision(applications, applicationId, status)` — pure function, immutably maps applications array, returns updated copy.
- `handleDecision(applicationId, status)` — calls `setApplications` with `applyLocalDecision`.
- Decision buttons (Approve, Shortlist, Waitlist, Decline) call `handleDecision` with the target status.
- State update is immediate and reflected in both the list (status badge) and the approved-companies band.

### Firestore Boundary Note

`applyLocalDecision` is annotated with:
```
// Future Firestore action boundary: replace local state update with PATCH /api/applications/[applicationId]/decision
```
No Firestore reads or writes are added. The function is pure except for the `setApplications` call in `handleDecision`.

### Lint Result

`npm run lint` — PASSED, no errors or warnings.

### Flags / Blockers

- No API routes added.
- No Firestore or Gemini work added.
- No files modified outside Context Scope.
- Ready for Evaluator audit.

    - Per mentor: counts `available` slots, total slots, and active/pending relationships.
    - Emits `"high-load"` warning when `activeRelationshipCount > 2`.
    - Emits `"insufficient-availability"` warning when `availableSlotCount < 1`.
  - All existing exports preserved: `getHealthBand`, `getHealthBandLabel`, `getDashboardSummary`, `getAttentionFeed`, `getRecentMeetings`, `getMentorCandidatesForCompany`, `findCompanyById`, `findMentorById`, `findRelationshipById`, and all associated interfaces.

### Helper Names Added

| Helper | Signature |
|---|---|
| `getApprovedStartupQueue` | `(programId: string, cohortId?: string) => ApprovedStartupQueueItem[]` |
| `getMentorPool` | `(programId: string, cohortId?: string) => MentorPoolItem[]` |

### Type Names Added

## 2026-05-16 20:15 — Coder → Evaluator

**Status**: DONE

### What Was Done

- Created `app/api/ai/match/route.ts` — POST route handler for the AI mentor matching boundary.
  - Parses JSON body safely; returns `400` for invalid JSON or non-object body.
  - Validates `startupId` (required string) and `programId` (required string); returns `400` for missing or wrong type.
  - Accepts optional `cohortId`; ignored unless it is a string.
  - Calls `getApprovedStartupQueue(programId, resolvedCohortId)` and searches by `company.id === startupId`; returns `404` if not found.
  - Calls `getMentorPool(programId, resolvedCohortId)` to load program/cohort-filtered mentors.
  - Computes deterministic match scores without calling Gemini using three internal helpers:
    - `computeBreakdown(mentor, company)` — returns `MatchBreakdown` with `industryMatch`, `stageFit`, `availability`, `styleCompatibility` (all 0–100).
    - `computeOverallScore(bd)` — weighted average: industry 35%, stage 30%, availability 20%, style 15%.
    - `buildReason(mentor, company, bd)` — deterministic reason string prioritising highest-scoring dimension.
  - Sorts by `overallScore` DESC then `mentorId` ASC for deterministic ordering.
  - Returns up to 3 matches; fewer when the pool has fewer mentors (no failure).
  - Mentor IDs are validated implicitly: all matches come from the `getMentorPool` output.
  - Response shape matches `POST /api/ai/match` in `DB_Module/_DOCS/03_SERVER_ACTIONS.md`: `{ matches: [{ mentorId, mentorName, overallScore, reason, breakdown }] }`.

### Route Behavior Summary

| Case | HTTP Status | Body |
|---|---|---|
| Invalid JSON | 400 | `{ error: "Invalid JSON body" }` |
| Missing startupId or programId | 400 | `{ error: "... is required..." }` |
| Startup not in approved unmatched queue | 404 | `{ error: "Startup not found..." }` |
| Valid request | 200 | `{ matches: [...] }` (0–3 items) |

### Verification

- `npm run lint` — PASSED, no errors or warnings.
- `npm run build` — PASSED. `/api/ai/match` appears as a dynamic route in the build output (10 routes total).

### Flags / Blockers

- `node_modules/next/dist/docs/01-app/03-building-your-application/01-routing/13-route-handlers.md` does not exist; route pattern follows `app/api/ai/program-fit/route.ts` as a reference instead.
- No Gemini call added. Gemini integration is deferred to the next instruction per the block plan.
- No Firestore, relationship creation, or matching UI added.
- No files modified outside Context Scope.
- Ready for Evaluator audit.

## 2026-05-16 20:45 — Coder → Evaluator

**Status**: DONE

### What Was Done

- Updated `app/api/ai/match/route.ts` — added Gemini prompt and structured response parsing on top of the deterministic fallback.

#### Changes from prior task

- Added `import { GoogleGenerativeAI } from "@google/generative-ai"`.
- Added `import type { ApprovedStartupQueueItem, MentorPoolItem } from "@/lib/verrier-analytics"`.
- Initialized `genAI` at module level: `new GoogleGenerativeAI(process.env.GEMINI_API_KEY || "")`.
- Extracted deterministic match generation into `buildDeterministicMatches(mentorPool, company): MatchResult[]` — same scoring logic as before, now callable before the Gemini attempt.
- Added `buildMatchPrompt(startupItem, mentorPool): string`:
  - Includes startup profile (name, stage, industries, business model, team size, MRR, support needs, founder summary).
  - Lists all mentor candidates with id, name, expertise, industries, preferred stages, style, hours/month, past successes.
  - Malaysia context guardrail: judges professional/business fit only.
  - Requires JSON response with `{ "matches": [...] }` shape and exact field names.
- Added `parseGeminiMatches(output: unknown, mentorMap: Map<string, Mentor>): MatchResult[] | null`:
  - Accepts unknown Gemini output safely.
  - Validates `matches` is a non-empty array.
  - Per item: requires `mentorId` (string) and validates it against the mentor pool map — invalid IDs are discarded.
  - Resolves `mentorName` from local mentor map (Gemini-returned names are not trusted).
  - Clamps all score fields to 0–100 via `clamp(Number(...))`.
  - Normalises missing or empty `reason` to a safe fallback string.
  - Returns `null` if no valid matches remain (triggers deterministic fallback).
- Updated `POST` flow:
  1. Input validation unchanged (400 for bad JSON or missing fields, 404 for unknown startup).
  2. `buildDeterministicMatches(mentorPool, company)` always called as fallback.
  3. Gemini attempted: `generateContent` with `responseMimeType: "application/json"`.
  4. JSON parse failure → return deterministic fallback.
  5. `parseGeminiMatches` returns null → log + return deterministic fallback.
  6. Any thrown error → log + return deterministic fallback.
  7. Valid Gemini matches → return Gemini result.

### Prompt / Parsing Behavior

- Prompt scope: startup profile + all programme mentor candidates + JSON format contract.
- Parser: validates structure, discards invalid mentor IDs, normalises scores, resolves names locally.
- Fallback triggers: Gemini API error, malformed JSON, empty or fully-invalid match array.

### Fallback Behavior

Deterministic matches (same as prior task) are always computed before the Gemini attempt and returned on any failure path. Response shape `{ matches: [...] }` is preserved in all paths.

### Verification

- `npm run lint` — PASSED, no errors or warnings.
- `npm run build` — PASSED. All 10 routes compile cleanly.

### Flags / Blockers

- No Firestore, relationship creation, or matching UI added.
- No files modified outside Context Scope.
- Ready for Evaluator audit.

  - Robust prompt builder with startup and mentor data.
  - Safe JSON parsing and ID validation.
  - Functional deterministic fallback for error paths.
  - Correct response shape (top 3 matches).

### Strategic Anchor

## 2026-05-16 21:30 — Coder → Evaluator

**Status**: DONE

### What Was Done

- Created `components/features/matching-workbench.tsx` — client component (`"use client"`).
  - Imports `ApprovedStartupQueueItem`, `MentorPoolItem` via `import type` from `lib/verrier-analytics`.
  - Props: `initialQueue`, `initialMentorPool`, `programId`, `cohortId`.
  - State: `selectedStartupId` (useState), `store` (useReducer with `MatchStore`: `matchState`, `matches`, `errorMessage`, `selectedMentorId`).
  - `matchReducer` handles four actions: `START` (resets all fetch state), `SUCCESS` (sets matches + done), `ERROR` (sets error message + error state), `SELECT_MENTOR` (toggles manual selection).
  - `useEffect([selectedStartupId, programId, cohortId])` with `cancelled` cleanup flag dispatches `START` then calls `POST /api/ai/match`; dispatches `SUCCESS` or `ERROR` in callbacks.
  - Left panel (`lg:w-72`): startup list with name, stage badge, industries, fit score, support needs.
  - Right panel (`flex-1`): startup summary bar → idle / loading / error / done states → ranked mentor cards.
  - Each mentor card: rank `#N`, name, mentorship style, currentRole + company, overallScore, Select/Selected toggle button, AI reason, 4-bar score breakdown, warning chips using `--status-risk` token.
  - Empty state when `initialQueue.length === 0`.
  - `useReducer` refactor resolves lint rule `react-hooks/set-state-in-effect` (synchronous setState in effect body).

- Created `app/matching/page.tsx` — server component (no `"use client"`).
  - Loads `seedPrograms[0]` and `seedCohorts[0]`.
  - Calls `getApprovedStartupQueue(program.id, cohort.id)` and `getMentorPool(program.id, cohort.id)`.
  - Renders `ProductShell` with `activeNav="Matching"`, `programName`, `cohortName`, `cohortWeeks`, `cohortStatus`.
  - Passes data to `MatchingWorkbench` via props.

### Lint Result

`npm run lint` — PASSED (zero errors, zero warnings).

### Build Result

`npm run build` — PASSED. `/matching` route appears as a static route (`○`) in build output (11 routes total).

### Flags / Blockers

- `react-hooks/set-state-in-effect` lint error in the original draft required switching to `useReducer`; all four synchronous setState calls were replaced with a single `dispatch({ type: "START" })` call. Callback dispatches satisfy the rule.
- `node_modules/next/dist/docs/01-app/03-building-your-application/01-routing/13-route-handlers.md` still does not exist; page pattern follows `app/dashboard/page.tsx` reference.
- `ProductShell` requires four additional props (`programName`, `cohortName`, `cohortWeeks`, `cohortStatus`) not mentioned in `_INSTRUCTION.md`; resolved by reading `product-shell.tsx` before writing the page.
- No Firestore, relationship creation, match confirmation, or analytics changes made.
- No files modified outside Context Scope.
- Ready for Evaluator audit.

- Created `_TASK/_INSTRUCTION.md` targeting task: "Add `POST /api/relationships/confirm-match` route and wire Confirm Match action into `matching-workbench.tsx`."

### Flags / Blockers
- No Firestore — route must build and return the Relationship-shaped record locally without any writes.
- `confirmedStartupIds` must be a separate `useState<Set<string>>` outside the reducer, since it persists across startup selections (the reducer resets per-startup state on `START`).
- `handleConfirm` must not be defined inside `useEffect` — define it in the component body.
- `lib/verrier-analytics.ts`, `lib/types.ts`, `lib/verrier-seed.ts`, and `components/features/product-shell.tsx` remain read-only.

**Status**: DONE

### What Was Done
- Created `app/api/relationships/confirm-match/route.ts`:
  - Implements POST handler with strict validation for `startupId`, `mentorId`, `programId`, `cohortId`, `matchScore`, `matchReason`, and `matchBreakdown`.
  - Builds a `Relationship`-shaped record with initial health values (`60`, `stable`) and returns it (no Firestore).
- Updated `components/features/matching-workbench.tsx`:
  - Added `confirmedStartupIds` local state (Set) to track confirmed matches during the session.
  - Expanded `MatchStore` and `matchReducer` with `confirmState` and `confirmError` lifecycle.
  - Implemented `handleConfirm` async function to call the confirmation API.
  - Derived `displayQueue` from `initialQueue` by filtering out confirmed startups.
  - Added a "Confirm Match" block below the ranked mentor cards that appears when a mentor is selected.
  - Updated the workbench to auto-select the next unconfirmed startup after confirmation.
  - Empty state now correctly checks the remaining `displayQueue`.

### Flags / Blockers
- Confirmation is local-only (demo mode). Relationship records are returned by the API but not persisted to Firestore.
- Confirmed startups disappear from the queue for the duration of the current page session.

**Status**: DONE

### What Was Done

- Created `components/features/relationship-list.tsx` — client component (`"use client"`).
  - Props: `relationships: Relationship[]`, `companies: Company[]`, `mentors: Mentor[]`.
  - Joins each relationship to its company and mentor via `Map<string, Company>` and `Map<string, Mentor>`.
  - Status filter: all, active, pending, paused, completed, terminated — with live count badges.
  - Health filter: all, healthy, at-risk, critical — derived from `getHealthBand(healthScore)` inline (≥70 healthy, ≥40 at-risk, <40 critical).
  - Summary strip: total relationships + healthy/at-risk/critical counts using Morandi status tokens.
  - Each relationship card renders: company name + status badge (Morandi status token per status), mentor name + role + company, health score + trend arrow (↑→↓) + health band label, cadence row (meeting count, days since last, match score, current milestone), AI diagnosis, watch point chips (`--status-risk` border), match reason (italic), match breakdown bars (4 keys, `--primary` fill, h-1).
  - `RelationshipStatus` type alias derived from `Relationship["status"]` to key `STATUS_COLORS` — avoids spurious TypeScript error from comparing `r.status` to `"all"`.
  - Empty state shown when filters hide all relationships.

- Created `app/relationships/page.tsx` — server component (no `"use client"`).
  - Loads `seedPrograms[0]`, `seedCohorts[0]`, `seedRelationships`, `seedCompanies`, `seedMentors`.
  - Renders `ProductShell` with `activeNav="Relationships"`, `programName`, `cohortName`, `cohortWeeks`, `cohortStatus`.
  - Passes seed data to `RelationshipList`.

### TypeScript Fix Applied

`STATUS_COLORS` was initially typed as `Record<Exclude<StatusFilter, "all">, string>`, causing a spurious TypeScript error when comparing `r.status` (typed as `Relationship["status"]`, which never includes `"all"`) to `"all"`. Fixed by aliasing `type RelationshipStatus = Relationship["status"]` and keying `STATUS_COLORS` on that type directly, then using `STATUS_COLORS[r.status]` unconditionally.

### Lint Result

`npm run lint` — PASSED (zero errors, zero warnings).

### Build Result

`npm run build` — PASSED. `/relationships` appears as a static route (`○`) in the build output (13 routes total).

### Flags / Blockers

- Relationship list shows seed data only; newly confirmed (in-session) relationships are not reflected since there is no shared persistence.
- No `/relationships/[id]` detail route added.
- No Firestore, meeting analysis, or health recomputation added.
- No files modified outside Context Scope.

  - **Stat row**: health score (colored by band) + trend arrow (↑→↓ with TREND_COLOR), meeting count, days since last, current milestone, match score, mentor role + style.
  - **AI diagnosis** and watch point chips (`--status-risk`) below the stat row.
  - **Milestone tracker** (5 stages — Discovery, Alignment, Execution, Scaling, Completion): connected line segments, filled circle for completed (status-healthy), primary-colored circle for current, border-only for pending. Completion dates shown below each completed node.
  - **Meeting timeline**: sorted by `meetingNumber` ascending. Each card shows: `#N`, date, duration, submittedBy, signal label (colored), health delta (`+N` / `-N`), AI summary, signal reason, action items (✓/○ with strikethrough for completed, owner + dueDate), watch point chips.
  - **Meeting upload shell**: toggled via "Log Meeting" / "Cancel" button. Disabled date input, duration input, textarea, and submit button with copy "Submit & Analyze — AI analysis coming in Block B."
  - Empty state shown when no meetings exist for the relationship.
  - `TimestampLike` handled safely in `formatDate` for string, Date, number, and Firestore-style `{ seconds }` shapes.

- Created `app/relationships/[id]/page.tsx` — async server component.
  - `await params` to read `id` per Next.js 16 dynamic route convention.
  - Finds relationship in `seedRelationships` by `id`; shows not-found state inside `ProductShell` when missing.
  - Joins company, mentor, cohort, program, and filtered meetings from seed data.
  - Renders `ProductShell` with `activeNav="Relationships"` + `RelationshipDetail`.

### Lint Result

`npm run lint` — PASSED (zero errors, zero warnings).

### Build Result

`npm run build` — PASSED. `/relationships/[id]` appears as a dynamic route (`ƒ`) in the build output (14 routes total).

## 2026-05-16 23:15 — Coder → Evaluator

**Status**: DONE

### What Was Done
- Created `components/features/meeting-submission-form.tsx` — client component (`"use client"`).
  - Four controlled fields: `token`, `date`, `durationMinutes`, `rawNotes`.
  - `resolveToken(token)`: finds mentor by `meetingSubmissionToken` in seed data, finds active/pending relationship for that mentor, returns `{ mentorName, companyName, healthScore, healthTrend, relationshipId }` or `null`.
  - Inline relationship context panel displayed when token resolves successfully.
  - `validate(fields)`: empty token → required; unresolved token → "Token not recognised"; missing date; duration ≤0 or >240 or NaN; notes <50 characters shows char count.
  - Per-field `touched` state; errors shown after blur or on submit attempt only.
  - Local `"confirmed"` state on valid submit (no API call): shows date, duration, notes character count, and "AI analysis is queued" message.
  - Character counter displayed live below notes field (`N / 50 min`).

- Created `app/submit-meeting/page.tsx` — public server component (no `ProductShell`, no auth).
  - Mobile-first `max-w-lg` centered layout.
  - Verrier wordmark + "Mentor meeting submission" subtitle.
  - Context copy describing the form purpose.
  - `MeetingSubmissionForm` component.
  - Footer note about token help.

### Validation Behavior
- Token: required + must resolve to an active/pending relationship in seed data.
- Date: required.
- Duration: required, must be 1–240 minutes.
- Notes: required, minimum 50 characters (char count shown in error).

### Confirmation Behavior
- Local state transition to `"confirmed"` with no API call.
- Confirmation panel shows: mentor × company pair, date, duration, notes character count, and AI analysis queued notice.

### Verification
- `npm run lint` — PASSED (zero errors, zero warnings).
- `npm run build` — PASSED. 15 routes compile cleanly including `/submit-meeting` as static.

### Flags / Blockers
- No API route, Gemini call, or Firestore work added.
- No files modified outside Context Scope.
- Ready for Evaluator audit.

**Status**: DONE

### What Was Done
- Confirmed `DB_Module/_PHASES/00_ROADMAP.md` still allocates work to Phase 4, Block B.
- Confirmed `_TASK/_PLAN.md` still targets the unchecked `POST /api/ai/analyze-meeting` route task.
- Refreshed `_TASK/_INSTRUCTION.md` with the latest Evaluator failure context so Coder creates the missing route file.

### Flags / Blockers
- Latest Evaluator result failed because no source changes were detected and `app/api/ai/analyze-meeting/route.ts` does not exist.
- This task remains server-route only; do not wire `/submit-meeting` to the route yet.

## 2026-05-17 00:10 — Coder → Evaluator

**Status**: DONE

### What Was Done
- Created `app/api/ai/analyze-meeting/route.ts` — POST route handler for meeting analysis.
  - Safe JSON parsing with `400` for invalid JSON or non-object body.
  - Validates `relationshipId` (required string), `date` (required string), `durationMinutes` (positive number), `rawNotes` (string, minimum 50 trimmed characters), `submittedBy` (`"admin"` | `"mentor"`).
  - Resolves relationship from `seedRelationships`; returns `404` when not found.
  - Deterministic fallback: `signal: "Neutral"`, `healthScoreDelta: 0`, `newHealthScore: relationship.healthScore`, empty `actionItems` and `watchPoints`, pending-notice `aiSummary`.
  - `clampDelta(val)`: clamps to `-15` through `15`.
  - `clampScore(val)`: clamps to `0` through `100`.
  - `buildMeetingPrompt(...)`: includes relationship context (companyId, mentorId, healthScore, healthTrend, currentMilestone), meeting date, duration, and raw notes. Malaysia 3R guardrail included. JSON response contract in prompt.
  - Gemini call with `responseMimeType: "application/json"` following the `program-fit` route pattern.
  - `normalizeActionItems(raw)`: validates each item, normalises `owner` to `ActionItemOwner`, sets `completed: false`, `completedAt: null`.
  - `normalizeSignal(val)`: accepts `"Positive"` | `"Neutral"` | `"Friction detected"`, defaults to `"Neutral"`.
  - All Gemini failure paths return the deterministic fallback.
  - Response shape aligned with `POST /api/ai/analyze-meeting` in `03_SERVER_ACTIONS.md`.

### Validation Behavior
- 400: invalid JSON, non-object body, missing/wrong-type `relationshipId`, missing `date`, non-positive `durationMinutes`, `rawNotes` < 50 chars, invalid `submittedBy`.
- 404: relationship not found in seed data.

### AI / Fallback Behavior
- Gemini attempted with JSON response mode.
- Fallback triggers: malformed JSON from Gemini, non-object parse result, any thrown error.
- `healthScoreDelta` clamped to -15..15; `newHealthScore = clampScore(relationship.healthScore + delta)`.
- `actionItems` normalised to `ActionItem` shape (no `any`).

### Verification
- `npm run lint` — PASSED (zero errors, zero warnings).
- `npm run build` — PASSED. 16 routes including `/api/ai/analyze-meeting` as dynamic (`ƒ`).

### Flags / Blockers
- No Firestore reads or writes. No seed data mutation. No form wiring.
- No files modified outside Context Scope.
- Ready for Evaluator audit.

## 2026-05-17 00:30 — Coder → Evaluator

**Status**: DONE

### What Was Done
- Created `app/api/ai/analyze-meeting/route.ts`:
  - Implements `POST` handler with JSON parsing and strict input validation (`relationshipId`, `date`, `durationMinutes`, `rawNotes`, `submittedBy`).
  - Verifies relationship existence in `seedRelationships`.
  - Implements Gemini integration with a structured prompt for meeting analysis (summary, action items, signal, health delta, watch points).
  - Normalizes AI output: clamps `healthScoreDelta` (-15 to 15) and `newHealthScore` (0-100), maps signals to official `MeetingSignal` type, and normalizes `ActionItem` array to match schema.
  - Provides a robust deterministic fallback for Gemini failures or malformed output.
- Fixed initial lint errors (`any` usage) and build errors (missing `ActionItem` properties).

### AI / Fallback Behavior
- **Success**: Returns AI-derived analysis based on notes.
- **Fallback**: Triggered on Gemini error or invalid JSON. Returns "Meeting notes received. AI analysis pending..." summary with neutral signal and 0 delta.

### Verification Result
- `npm run lint` — PASSED.
- `npm run build` — PASSED. `/api/ai/analyze-meeting` added as a dynamic route.

### Flags / Blockers
- No Firestore writes or seed mutation added.
- Public form wiring is deferred to the next task.

### Handover Payload
- Modified files: `app/api/ai/analyze-meeting/route.ts`, `DB_Module/_TASK/_Hand_OverLog.md`
- Ready for Evaluator audit.

- Verified `app/api/ai/analyze-meeting/route.ts` implementation:
  - Robust request validation (notes >= 50 chars).
  - Schema-compliant `MeetingSignal` and `ActionItem` mapping.
  - Correct health delta clamping (-15 to 15).
  - Deterministic fallback for Gemini failures.

### Strategic Anchor
- Phase: PHASE_4__Relationship_Health_and_Cohort_Intelligence

**Status**: DONE

### What Was Done
- Confirmed `DB_Module/_PHASES/00_ROADMAP.md` still allocates work to Phase 4, Block B.
- Updated `DB_Module/_PHASES/PHASE_4__Relationship_Health_and_Cohort_Intelligence.md` to mark the passed meeting analysis route and prompt work complete.
- Updated `_TASK/_PLAN.md` so the current target is wiring `/submit-meeting` to `POST /api/ai/analyze-meeting` and showing returned analysis in local UI state.
- Replaced `_TASK/_INSTRUCTION.md` with a scoped Coder task for `components/features/meeting-submission-form.tsx`.

### Flags / Blockers
- Latest Evaluator result passed the backend route.
- Keep `app/api/ai/analyze-meeting/route.ts` read-only in the next task.
- Keep updates local to the public form UI; no Firestore writes, seed mutation, or relationship detail timeline mutation.
- `DB_Module/_DOCS/06_DEPENDENCY_GRAPH.md` is stale and does not list the target form.

## 2026-05-17 01:10 — Coder → Evaluator

**Status**: DONE

### What Was Done
- Updated `components/features/meeting-submission-form.tsx` — wired public form to `POST /api/ai/analyze-meeting`.
  - Added `import type { ActionItem } from "@/lib/types"` for typed action items.
  - Added `AnalysisResult` interface: `meetingId`, `aiSummary`, `actionItems: ActionItem[]`, `signal`, `signalReason`, `healthScoreDelta`, `newHealthScore`, `watchPoints`.
  - Extended `FormState` from `"idle" | "confirmed"` to `"idle" | "submitting" | "confirmed"`.
  - Added `apiError: string | null` state for inline API error display.
  - Extended `confirmed` state to include `analysis: AnalysisResult` alongside existing `date`, `durationMinutes`, `notesLength`, `context`.
  - `handleSubmit` made `async`: validates first (unchanged), then calls `POST /api/ai/analyze-meeting` with `{ relationshipId, date, durationMinutes: Number(...), rawNotes, submittedBy: "mentor" }`.
  - Non-OK response: extracts `error` string from body, sets `apiError`, resets to `"idle"` — form stays available.
  - Network error: sets `apiError`, resets to `"idle"`.
  - Success: normalises response into `AnalysisResult` (lowercase signal normalised via `normaliseSignal()`), sets `confirmed` + `"confirmed"` state.
  - `normaliseSignal()`: handles lowercase `"positive"`, `"neutral"`, `"negative"` / `"friction..."` from route fallback path.
  - Submit button: disabled + label `"Analysing..."` while submitting.
  - Confirmed view replaced: shows AI summary, signal badge (Morandi tokens), signal reason, health delta (+N/-N coloured), new health score (coloured by band), action item list (owner, task, due date), watch point chips.
  - All existing client-side validation (token, date, duration, notes) preserved unchanged.
  - No Firestore reads or writes. No seed data mutation. No API route changes.

### UI Behavior
- Submit → "Analysing..." spinner state → confirmed view with AI analysis or inline error.
- Non-OK API: inline error under form, form remains editable.
- Confirmed view signal badge: green for Positive, amber for Friction detected, muted for Neutral.
- Health delta: green for positive, red for negative, unstyled for zero.
- Action items: owner capitalised, task text, due date when present.
- Watch point chips: amber border + text.

### Verification
- `npm run lint` — PASSED (zero errors, zero warnings).
- `npm run build` — PASSED. 16 routes, all compile cleanly.
